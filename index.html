        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a current graduate from Illinois Institute of Technology
          majoring in Information Technology and Management. I have also received
          my Bachelor and Master degree in Web and Application Development with
          a specialization in Web Design and Application Development. I
          have always loved working with computers, but it wasn't until high
          school when I got introduced to computer programming with HTML and Java.
          It was at this moment when realized that this is what I want to do for
          a living.
