        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Tyler Tomasello, student at Illinois Institute of Technology
          majoring in Information Technology and Management. I am also going
          for a masters degree in Web and Application Development. I was born
          in May of 1996 in Berwyn, Illinois where I still live to this day. I
          have always loved working with computers, but it wasn't until high
          school when I got introduced to computer programming. It was at this
          moment when realized that this is what I want to do for a living.
